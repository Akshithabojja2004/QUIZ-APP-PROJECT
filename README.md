Creating a quiz app is an excellent way to learn the fundamentals of web development. In this tutorial, we will build a Quiz App that features a timer, allowing users to take a timed quiz with multiple-choice questions. The app will use HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality, including the timer and score tracking.

About index.html 

* The quiz app starts with `<!DOCTYPE html>` which tells the browser this is an HTML5 document. Then, the `<html lang="en">` tag wraps the whole page and specifies that the content is in English.

Inside the `<head>` section, we have:

* `<meta charset="UTF-8">` which ensures all characters (like symbols and emojis) display correctly,
* `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` which makes the layout responsive on all screen sizes,
* `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">` which connects to a CSS file to style the page,
* and `<title>Quiz App</title>`, which sets the title that appears on the browser tab.

In the `<body>`, the main content is inside a `<div class="quiz-container" id="quiz">`, which serves as the main wrapper for everything.

Within that, there's a `<div class="quiz-header">` that holds the actual quiz content:

* `<h2 id="question">Question text</h2>` is where each quiz question will appear.
* Then, a list of answer choices is shown using `<ul>` (unordered list) and four `<li>` (list item) tags, one for each answer option.

Each answer option has:

* an `<input type="radio">` with `name="answer"` so all options are part of the same group (allowing only one selection),
* and a `<label>` with `for="a"` (or b, c, d) so that clicking on the label also selects the radio button.

Each radio input and label has a unique `id` (like `id="a"` and `id="a_text"`) so JavaScript can change the text for each option dynamically.

At the bottom, there's a `<button id="submit">Submit</button>` that users click to submit their answer.

Finally, `<script src="script.js"></script>` links to an external JavaScript file that will handle everything behind the scenes—like showing new questions, checking answers, and keeping score.

About script.js file

* This JavaScript code powers a simple quiz app. It starts with a `quizData` array containing quiz questions, answer options (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`), and the correct answer for each. When the page loads, the `loadQuiz()` function displays the current question and its options in the HTML. The function `deselectAnswers()` clears any previously selected radio buttons, and `getSelected()` checks which answer the user selected. When the user clicks the submit button, the script checks if the selected answer is correct, updates the score, and moves to the next question. When all questions are done, it shows the final score and provides a button to restart the quiz by reloading the page.

About style.css file
 * This CSS styles a clean and centered quiz app using the Poppins font. The `body` has a gradient background and uses Flexbox to center the `.quiz-container`, which has a white background, rounded corners, and a shadow. Inside, the `.quiz-header` adds padding around the question (`h2`) and answers (`ul > li`). The list has no default styling, with each option spaced and clickable via styled `label` tags. The `button` spans the full width, has a purple background that changes on hover and focus, and inherits the overall font style for consistency.
